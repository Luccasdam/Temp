Project Setup took about 50 minutes
Double Jump about 10 minutes
Interaction System Took about 2 hours, including:
    *Interact Interface
    *Interact Component
    *Interactive Door
    *Interactive Button
    *Meshes creation

Given more time I would made the interact system work in multiplayer.
I would make the use of InstigatorActor passed by InteractInterface to be able to grab objects.
Divide the FindBestActorToInteract() into small chunks of code
